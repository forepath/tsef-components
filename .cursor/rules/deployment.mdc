# Deployment Guidelines

This document defines comprehensive deployment strategies and patterns for ensuring reliable, scalable, and maintainable application deployments.

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## General Deployment Rules

- Applications **MUST** implement automated deployment pipelines.
- Applications **MUST** use infrastructure as code (IaC) for environment management.
- Applications **SHOULD** implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies.
- Applications **MUST** have rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

> **Related Guidelines**: See [applications.mdc](./applications.mdc) for application deployment requirements and [agents.mdc](./agents.mdc) for deployment validation requirements.

## Environment Management

- Configuration **MUST** support different values per environment.
- Configuration **SHOULD** use secrets management for sensitive data.

### Environment Promotion

- Code **MUST** flow through environments in a controlled manner.
- Environment promotion **SHOULD** include automated testing and validation.
- Environment promotion **MUST** require approval for production deployments.
- Environment promotion **SHOULD** implement feature flags for controlled rollouts.

## Containerization

### Docker Best Practices

- Applications **MUST** be containerized using Docker.
- Docker images **SHOULD** use minimal base images.

### Container Orchestration

- Applications **SHOULD** use container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
- Container orchestration **MUST** implement health checks and liveness probes.
- Container orchestration **SHOULD** support horizontal pod autoscaling.
- Container orchestration **MUST** implement resource limits and requests.

### Container Security

- Containers **MUST** run with non-root users.
- Containers **SHOULD** use read-only root filesystems.
- Containers **MUST** implement proper secrets management.
- Containers **SHOULD** use security contexts and pod security policies.

## CI/CD Pipelines

### Pipeline Design

- Pipelines **SHOULD** be fast, reliable, and maintainable.
- Pipelines **MUST** include automated testing and quality gates.
- Pipelines **SHOULD** support parallel execution where possible.

### Pipeline Stages
